Hi, I'm Heather Acuna

I'm a Computer Science major at the College of William & Mary (class of '25), and I'm interested in all things coding, particularly web development and software engineering.

I know Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'm always happy to learn more!

Feel free to contact me with any questions at hacuna417@gmail.com
